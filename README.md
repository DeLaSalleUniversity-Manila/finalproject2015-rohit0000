# TexTo


## Prerequisites
1) Tesseract Library (only the tess two from : https://github.com/rmtheis/tess-two)

## Details
Our project makes use of the Tesseract Library which will be used for the OCR. These words will then be stored in a database.
Our project also makes use of Microsoft translator which will translate the recognized text to German, French, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean. We allow the user to take a picture of retrieve an image from the gallery. 

## Limitations
We cannot successfully let our app read all of the text shown in the camera. We recommend taking plain text with a 
white background to allow the text recognition algorithm to read the text. Once translated, internet connection is 
a must in order to translate the word in different languages.
